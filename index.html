                      ― I'm the most successful person ever to run for the

                      than me. I'm the most successful person ever to run. Ross
                      Perot isn't successful like me. Romney ― I have a Gucci
                      store that's worth more than Romney. Sorry losers and
                      haters, but my IQ is one of the highest ― and you all know
                      it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your
                      fault.
